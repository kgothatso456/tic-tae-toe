The game is designed in such a way that the player represents "O" and the computer is "X".

The game board is a 3x3 grid that consists of numbered cells. Each cell has a unique number ranging from 1 to 9 starting from the top left corner cell.

The computer will then automatically make a move, and the game will continue until either someone wins or a tie is declared.
